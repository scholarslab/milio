# Upgrading Omeka

1. Log onto `cnhi-milio.nursing.virginia.edu` using the username and password from the milio-2016-12-07 file in the same box directory as this file.

2. Change to the direcctory containing the Omeka site by typing this:

   cd /var/www/html

3. Run the upgrade script by typing this:

   ./upgrade-omeka

4. Log in as admin and make sure everything still works: http://cnhi-milio.nursing.virginia.edu/admin/ 

5. If anything seems to be wrong, you'll need to call someone in the Scholars' Lab to help sort it out.
